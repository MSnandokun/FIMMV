**Project Description**
This is a Forefront Identity Manager Metaverse Extension that will provide codeless provisioning by allowing the user to create a special MA in which the flows defined become the initial mappings used during provisioning.

This project became a natural extension to the work I did for the Last FIM Workflow You Will Ever Need [http://www.apollojack.com/2012/02/last-fim-workflow-you-will-ever-need.html](http://www.apollojack.com/2012/02/last-fim-workflow-you-will-ever-need.html) and the Last FIM Management Agent Rules Extension You Will Ever Need [http://www.apollojack.com/2013/02/the-last-fim-management-agent-rules.html](http://www.apollojack.com/2013/02/the-last-fim-management-agent-rules.html). This project is still in its infancy and has only been unit tested, but I wanted to get it out to you in case it might help anyone, as well as, get improvements from the community.
